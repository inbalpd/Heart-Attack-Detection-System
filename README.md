# Heart-Attack-Detection-System
This project detect heart attacks by medical information. 
At the begining there is data analysis of the medical information, to understand the data and make sure that it has some affect on the target.
The detection is by using Machine Learning algorithms such as decision tree, Neural Networks and k-means.
For each ML algorithm there is a process of hyper-tuning.
